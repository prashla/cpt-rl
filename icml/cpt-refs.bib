	Abstract = {Surjectivity of linear projections between distribution families with fixed mean and covariance (regardless of dimension) is re-derived by a new proof. We further extend this property to distribution families that respect additional constraints, such as symmetry, unimodality and log-concavity. By combining our results with classic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural risk criteria arising in classification, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov decision processes.},
