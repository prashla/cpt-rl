%For the sake of notational simplicity, we let $X$ denote the r.v. $X^\theta$, i.e., where the parameter $\theta$ is assumed to be fixed for the purpose of CPT-value estimation in this section. \todoc{If we remove the $X^\theta$ business from above, this sentence can be removed.}

%\paragraph{On integrability}
Before diving into the details of CPT-value estimation, let us discuss the conditions necessary for the CPT-value to be well-defined.
Observe that the first integral in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}, i.e., 
$\int_0^{+\infty} w^+\left(\Prob{u^+(X)>z}\right) d z$
may diverge even if the first moment of random variable $u^+(X)$ is finite. 
For example, suppose $U$ has the tail distribution function
$\Prob{U>z}  = \frac{1}{z^2}, z\in [1, +\infty),$
 and $w^+(z)$ takes the form $w(z) = z^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Then, the first integral in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}, i.e.,
$
\int_1^{+\infty}  z^{-\frac{2}{3}}\, dz
$
does not even exist. A similar argument applies to the second integral in \eqref{eq:cpt-general} as well.

To overcome the above integrability issues, we impose additional  assumptions on the weight and/or utility functions. In particular, we assume that the weight functions $w^+, w^-$ are either 
\begin{inparaenum}[\it (i)]
\item Lipschitz continuous, or
\item \holder continuous, or
\item locally Lipschitz.
\end{inparaenum}
We devise a scheme for estimating \eqref{eq:cpt-general} given only samples from $X$ and show that, under each of the aforementioned assumptions, our estimator (presented next) converges almost surely. 
We also provide sample complexity bounds assuming that the utility functions are bounded.

\subsection{Estimation scheme for \holder continuous weights}
Recall the H\"{o}lder continuity property first:
\begin{definition}\label{holder}
{\textbf{\textit{(H\"{o}lder continuity)}}}
A function $f \in C([a,b])$ is said to satisfy
a H\"{o}lder condition of order $\alpha\in (0,1]$ (or to be H\"{o}lder continuous
of order $\alpha$) if there exists $ H>0$, s.t.
\[
\sup_{x \neq y} \frac{| f(x) - f(y) |}{| x-y |^{\alpha}} \leq H .
\]
\end{definition}

In order to ensure the integrability of the CPT-value \eqref{eq:cpt-general}, we make the following assumption:\\[1ex]
\textbf{Assumption (A1).}  
The weight functions $w^+, w^-$ are H\"{o}lder continuous with common order $\alpha$. Further,
there exists $ \gamma \le \alpha$ such that (s.t.)
$\int_0^{+\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\gamma} (u^+(X)>z) dz < +\infty$ and $\int_0^{+\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\gamma} (u^-(X)>z) dz < +\infty$,
where $\mathbb{P}^{\gamma}(\cdot) = \left(\mathbb{P}(\cdot)\right)^{\gamma}$.

The above assumption ensures that the CPT-value as defined by \eqref{eq:cpt-general} is finite - see Proposition 
\ref{prop:Holder-cpt-finite} in Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs} for a formal proof.


\paragraph{Approximating CPT-value using quantiles:}
Let $\xi^+_{k}$ denote the $k$th quantile of the r.v. $u^+(X)$. 
Then, it can be seen that (see Proposition \ref{prop:holder-quantile} in Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs})
\begin{align}
&\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi^+_{\frac{i}{n}} \left(w^+\left(\frac{n+1-i}{n}\right)- w^+\left(\frac{n-i}{n}\right) \right) \nonumber\\
&= \int_0^{+\infty} w^+\left(\Prob{u^+(X)>z}\right) dz.\label{eq:holder-quant-motiv}
\end{align}
A similar claim holds with $u^-(X)$, $\xi^-_{\alpha}, w^-$ in place of  $u^+(X)$, $\xi^+_{\alpha}, w^+$, respectively. Here $\xi^-_{\alpha}$ denotes the 
$\alpha$th quantile of $u^-(X)$.

However, we do not know the distribution of $u^+(X)$ or $u^-(X)$ and hence, we next present a procedure that uses order statistics for estimating quantiles and this in turn assists estimation of the CPT-value along the lines of \eqref{eq:holder-quant-motiv}. The estimation scheme is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{CPT-value estimation for \holder continuous weights}
\label{alg:holder-est}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Simulate $n$ i.i.d. samples from the distribution of $X$.
%\State Calculate $u^+(X_{[1]}),\ldots u^+(X_{[n]}).$
\State Order the samples and label them as follows: 
$X_{[1]}, X_{[2]}, \ldots ,X_{[n]}$. Note that $u^+(X_{[1]}),\ldots ,u^+(X_{[n]})$ are also in ascending order.
%\State Use $u^+(X_{[i]}), i\in \mathbb{N}\cap (0,n)$ as an approximation for the $\frac{i}{n} th$ quantile of $u^+(X)$, i.e, $\xi_{\frac{i}{n}}, i\in \mathbb{N}\cap (0,n)$.
\State Let

$$\hspace{-1.1em}\overline \C_n^+:=\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^+(X_{[i]}) \left(w^+\!\left(\frac{n+1-i}{n}\right)\!-\! w^+\!\left(\frac{n-i}{n}\right) \right).$$
\vspace{-0.5ex}
\State Apply $u^{-}$ on the sequence $\{X_{[1]}, X_{[2]}, \ldots ,X_{[n]}\}$; notice that $u^{-}(X_{[i]})$ is in descending order since $u^{-}$ is a decreasing function.     
\State Let
\vspace{-0.5ex}
$$\overline \C_n^-:=\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^-(X_{[i]}) \left(w^-\left(\frac{i}{n}\right)- w^-\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\right) \right). $$

\vspace{-0.5ex}
\State Return $\overline \C_n =\overline \C_n^+ - \overline \C_n^-$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection*{Main results}
%We make the following assumptions on the utility functions:\\[1ex]

%For the sample complexity results below, we require (A2'), while (A2) is sufficient to prove asymptotic consistency.
\begin{proposition}(\textbf{Asymptotic consistency})
\label{prop:holder-asymptotic}
Assume (A1) and that $F^+(\cdot)$ and $F^-(\cdot)$, the respective distribution functions of $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$, 
are Lipschitz continuous 
%with constants $L^+$ and $L^-$, respectively, 
on the respective intervals $(0,+\infty)$, and 
$(-\infty, 0)$. Then, we have that
\begin{align}
\overline \C_n
\rightarrow
\C(X)
 \text{   a.s. as } n\rightarrow \infty
\end{align}
where $\overline \C_n$ is as defined in Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est} and $\C(X)$ as in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
See Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs}. 
\end{proof}
%Our next result concerns the rate at which the estimate $\overline \C_n$ converges to the CPT-value $\C(X)$. 
%Under (A2') stated below, 
Under additional assumptions on utility functions,
our next result shows that $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2/\alpha}}\right)$ number of samples are sufficient to get a
high-probability estimate of the CPT-value that is $\epsilon$-accurate:

\textbf{Assumption (A2).}  The utility functions $u^+$ and $-u^-$ are continuous and strictly increasing.

%\textbf{Assumption (A2').}  In addition to (A2), the utilities $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ are bounded above by $M<\infty$ w.p. 1.

\begin{proposition}(\textbf{Sample complexity.})
\label{prop:holder-dkw}
Assume (A1), (A2) and also that the utilities $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ are bounded above by $M<\infty$ w.p. 1. Then, $\forall \epsilon >0, \delta >0$, we have
$$
\Prob{\left |\overline \C_n- \C(X) \right| \leq  \epsilon } >1- \delta\text{     ,} \forall n \geq \ln\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\cdot 
\frac{4H^2 M^2}{\epsilon^{2/\alpha}}.$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
%
%%Notice the the following equivalence:
%%$$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} u^+(X_{[i]}) (w^+(\frac{n-i}{n}) - w^+(\frac{n-i-1}{n})) =  \int_0^M w^+(1-\widehat{F^+_n}(x)) dx, $$
%%and also,
%%$$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} u^-(X_{[i]}) (w^-(\frac{n-i}{n}) - w^-(\frac{n-i-1}{n})) =  \int_0^M w^-(1-\widehat{F^-_n}(x)) dx, $$
%%
%%where $\widehat{F^+_n}(x)$ and $\widehat{F^-_n}(x)$ are the empirical distribution functions (EDFs) of $u^+(X)$
%%and $u^-(X)$, defined as follows:
%%\begin{align}
%%{\widehat F_n}^+(x)=&\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{(u^+(X_i) \leq x)}, 
%%{\widehat F_n}^-(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{(u^-(X_i) \leq x)}.
%%\label{eq:edf}
%%\end{align}
%%The main claim follows from the equivalence mentioned above together with the well-known Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality (cf. Chapter 2 of \cite{wasserman2006}).
%
See Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs}.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Results for Lipschitz continuous weights}
In the previous section, it was shown that \holder continuous weights incur a sample complexity of order $O\left(\frac1{\epsilon^{2/\alpha}}\right)$ and this is higher than the canonical Monte Carlo rate of $O\left(\frac1{\epsilon^2}\right)$. In this section, we establish that one can achieve the canonical Monte Carlo rate if we consider Lipschitz continuous weights, i.e., the following assumption in place of (A1):
 
\textbf{Assumption (A1').}  The weight functions $w^+, w^-$ are Lipschitz with common constant $L$, and 
$u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ both have bounded first moments.

Setting $\alpha=1$, one can make special cases of the claims regarding asymptotic convergence and sample complexity of Proposition \ref{prop:holder-asymptotic}--\ref{prop:holder-dkw}. However, these results are under  a restrictive Lipschitz assumption on the distribution functions of $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$. Using a different proof technique that employs the dominated convergence theorem and Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality, one can obtain results similar to Proposition \ref{prop:holder-asymptotic}--\ref{prop:holder-dkw} with (A1') and (A2) only. The following claim makes this precise.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:lipschitz}
Assume (A1') and (A2). Then, we have that 
$$\overline \C_n
\rightarrow
\C(X)
 \text{   a.s. as } n\rightarrow \infty
$$
In addition, if we assume that the utilities $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ are bounded above by $M<\infty$ w.p. 1, then we have $\forall \epsilon >0, \delta >0$, 
$$
\Prob{\left |\overline \C_n- \C(X) \right| \leq  \epsilon } > 1-\delta\text{     ,} \forall n \geq \ln\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\cdot 
\frac{4L^2 M^2}{\epsilon^{2}}.
$$
\end{proposition}
Note that according to this proposition, our estimation scheme is sample-efficient (choosing the weights to be the identity function, the sample complexity cannot be improved).
\begin{proof}
See Section \ref{sec:lipschitz-proofs}.
