%For the sake of notational simplicity, we let $X$ denote the r.v. $X^\theta$, i.e., where the parameter $\theta$ is assumed to be fixed for the purpose of CPT-value estimation in this section. \todoc{If we remove the $X^\theta$ business from above, this sentence can be removed.}

%\paragraph{On integrability}
Before diving into the details of CPT-value estimation, let us discuss the conditions necessary for the CPT-value to be well-defined.
Observe that the first integral in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}, i.e., 
$\int_0^{+\infty} w^+\left(\Prob{u^+(X)>z}\right) d z$
may diverge even if the first moment of random variable $u^+(X)$ is finite. 
For example, suppose $U$ has the tail distribution function
$\Prob{U>z}  = \frac{1}{z^2}, z\in [1, +\infty),$
 and $w^+(z)$ takes the form $w(z) = z^{\frac{1}{3}}$. Then, the first integral in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}, i.e.,
$
\int_1^{+\infty}  z^{-\frac{2}{3}}\, dz
$
does not even exist. A similar argument applies to the second integral in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}.

To overcome the above integrability issues, we impose additional  assumptions on the weight and/or utility functions. In particular, we assume that the weight functions $w^+, w^-$ are either 
\begin{inparaenum}[\it (i)]
\item Lipschitz continuous, or
\item \holder continuous, or
\item locally Lipschitz.
\end{inparaenum}
We devise a scheme for estimating \eqref{eq:cpt-general} given only samples from $X$ and show that, under each of the aforementioned assumptions, our estimator (presented next) converges almost surely. 
We also provide sample complexity bounds, assuming that the utility functions are bounded.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{CPT-value estimation using quantiles}
Let $\xi^+_{k}$ and $\xi^-_{k}$ denote the $k$th quantiles of the r.v.s $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$, respectively. 
Then, it can be seen that (see Proposition \ref{prop:holder-quantile} in Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs})
\begin{align}
&\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi^+_{\frac{i}{n}} \left(w^+\left(\frac{n+1-i}{n}\right)- w^+\left(\frac{n-i}{n}\right) \right) \nonumber\\
&= \int_0^{+\infty} w^+\left(\Prob{u^+(X)>z}\right) dz.\label{eq:holder-quant-motiv}
\end{align}
A similar claim holds with $u^-(X)$, $\xi^-_{k}, w^-$ in place of  $u^+(X)$, $\xi^+_{\alpha}, w^+$, respectively. 

However, we do not know the distribution of $u^+(X)$ or $u^-(X)$ and hence, we next present a procedure that uses order statistics for estimating quantiles and this in turn assists estimation of the CPT-value along the lines of \eqref{eq:holder-quant-motiv}. The estimation scheme is presented in Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est}.

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{CPT-value estimation}
\label{alg:holder-est}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State Simulate $n$ i.i.d. samples from the distribution of $X$.
%\State Calculate $u^+(X_{[1]}),\ldots u^+(X_{[n]}).$
\State Order the samples and label them as follows: 
$X_{[1]}, X_{[2]}, \ldots ,X_{[n]}$. Note that $u^+(X_{[1]}),\ldots ,u^+(X_{[n]})$ are also in ascending order.
%\State Use $u^+(X_{[i]}), i\in \mathbb{N}\cap (0,n)$ as an approximation for the $\frac{i}{n} th$ quantile of $u^+(X)$, i.e, $\xi_{\frac{i}{n}}, i\in \mathbb{N}\cap (0,n)$.
\State Let
\vspace{-0.5ex}
$$\hspace{-1.1em}\overline \C_n^+:=\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^+(X_{[i]}) \left(w^+\!\left(\frac{n+1-i}{n}\right)\!-\! w^+\!\left(\frac{n-i}{n}\right) \right).$$
\vspace{-0.5ex}
\State Apply $u^{-}$ on the sequence $\{X_{[1]}, X_{[2]}, \ldots ,X_{[n]}\}$; notice that $u^{-}(X_{[i]})$ is in descending order since $u^{-}$ is a decreasing function.     
\State Let
\vspace{-0.5ex}
$$\overline \C_n^-:=\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^-(X_{[i]}) \left(w^-\left(\frac{i}{n}\right)- w^-\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\right) \right). $$

\vspace{-0.5ex}
\State Return $\overline \C_n =\overline \C_n^+ - \overline \C_n^-$.
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
Notice the the following equivalence: 
%\todoc{The hats should be on $F$ only, as in $\hat{F}^+$ as opposed to $\hat{F^+}$.}
\begin{align*}
&\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^+\left(X_{[i]}\right) \left(w^+\left(\frac{n+1-i}{n}\right) - w^+\left(\frac{n-i}{n}\right)\right) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^{n} w^+\left(\frac{n-i}{n}\right) \left(u^+\left(X_{[i+1]}\right) - u^+\left(X_{[i]} \right)\right)\\
&=  \int_0^{\infty} w^+\left(1-\hat{F}^+_n\left(x\right)\right) dx, 
\end{align*}
% \todoj[inline]{Add a few steps above to make the equivalence clear}
and also,
\begin{align*}
&\sum_{i=1}^{n} u^-\left(X_{[i]}\right) \left(w^-\left(\frac{i}{n}\right) - w^-\left(\frac{i-1}{n}\right)\right)\\
& =  \int_0^{\infty} w^-\left(1-\hat{F}^-_n\left(x\right)\right) dx, 
\end{align*}
where $\hat{F}^+_n\left(x\right)$ and $\hat{F}^-_n\left(x\right)$ are the empirical distributions of $u^+\left(X\right)$
and $u^-\left(X\right)$, respectively.

Thus, the CPT estimator $\overline \C_n$ in Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est} can be written equivalently as follows:
\begin{align}
\overline \C_n = \intinfinity w^+\left(1-{\hat F_n}^+\left(x\right)\right)  dx \!-\! \intinfinity w^-\left(1-{\hat F_n}^-\left(x\right)\right)  dx.
\label{eq:cpt-est-appendix}
\end{align}

Consider the special case when $w^+(p)=w^-(p)=p$ and $u^+$ ($-u^-$), when restricted to the positive (respectively, negative) half line, are the identity functions. In this case, the CPT-value estimator $\overline \C_n$ coincides with the sample mean estimator for regular expectation.

\subsection{Results for \holder continuous weights}
Recall the H\"{o}lder continuity property first:
\begin{definition}\label{holder}
{\textbf{\textit{(H\"{o}lder continuity)}}}
A function $f \in C([a,b])$ is said to satisfy
a H\"{o}lder condition of order $\alpha\in (0,1]$ (or to be H\"{o}lder continuous
of order $\alpha$) if there exists $ H>0$, s.t.
\[
\sup_{x \neq y} \frac{| f(x) - f(y) |}{| x-y |^{\alpha}} \leq H .
\]
\end{definition}

%In order to ensure the integrability of the CPT-value \eqref{eq:cpt-general}, we make the following assumption:\\[1ex]
\noindent\textbf{Assumption (A1).}  
The weight functions $w^+, w^-$ are H\"{o}lder continuous with common order $\alpha$ and constant $H$. Further,
there exists $ \gamma \le \alpha$ such that (s.t.)
$\int_0^{+\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\gamma} (u^+(X)>z) dz < +\infty$ and $\int_0^{+\infty} \mathbb{P}^{\gamma} (u^-(X)>z) dz < +\infty$,
where $\mathbb{P}^{\gamma}(\cdot) = \left(\mathbb{P}(\cdot)\right)^{\gamma}$.

The above assumption ensures that the CPT-value as defined by \eqref{eq:cpt-general} is finite - see Proposition 
\ref{prop:Holder-cpt-finite} in Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs} for a formal proof.



%\subsubsection*{Main results}
%We make the following assumptions on the utility functions:\\[1ex]

%For the sample complexity results below, we require (A2'), while (A2) is sufficient to prove asymptotic consistency.
\begin{proposition}(\textbf{Asymptotic consistency})
\label{prop:holder-asymptotic}
Assume (A1) and that \\
\begin{inparaenum}[\bfseries (i)]
\item $F^+(\cdot)$ and $F^-(\cdot)$, the respective distribution functions of $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$, 
are Lipschitz continuous on the respective intervals $(0,+\infty)$, and 
$(-\infty, 0)$; \\
\item Utility functions $u^+, u^-$ satisfy 
$$\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{u^+(X_{[n]})}{n^{\alpha}}\rightarrow 0 \text{ and }\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{u^-(X_{[n]})}{n^{\alpha}}\rightarrow 0.$$
\end{inparaenum}
Then, we have 
\begin{align}
\overline \C_n
\rightarrow
\C(X)
 \text{   a.s. as } n\rightarrow \infty
\end{align}
where $\overline \C_n$ is as defined in Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est} and $\C(X)$ as in \eqref{eq:cpt-general}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
See Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs}. 
\end{proof}
%Our next result concerns the rate at which the estimate $\overline \C_n$ converges to the CPT-value $\C(X)$. 
%Under (A2') stated below, 
Under an additional assumption on the utility functions,
our next result shows that $O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2/\alpha}}\right)$ number of samples are sufficient to get a
high-probability estimate of the CPT-value that is $\epsilon$-accurate:

\noindent\textbf{Assumption (A2).}  The utility functions $u^+$ and $-u^-$ are continuous and strictly increasing.

%\textbf{Assumption (A2').}  In addition to (A2), the utilities $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ are bounded above by $M<\infty$ w.p. 1.

\begin{proposition}(\textbf{Sample complexity.})
\label{prop:holder-dkw}
Assume (A1), (A2) and also that the utilities $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ are bounded above by $M<\infty$ w.p. 1. Then, $\forall \epsilon >0, \delta >0$, we have
$$
\Prob{\left |\overline \C_n- \C(X) \right| \leq  \epsilon } >1- \delta\text{     ,} \forall n \geq \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{4}{\delta}\right)
\left(\frac{HM}{\epsilon}\right)^{\frac{2}{\alpha}}.$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{corollary}
\label{cor:holder-dkw}
Under the conditions of Proposition \ref{prop:holder-dkw}, we have
$$
\E \left|\overline \C_n- \C(X) \right|  \le    \frac{\left(8HM\right) \Gamma\left(\alpha/2\right)}{n^{\alpha/2}},$$
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ is the gamma function.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
%
%%Notice the the following equivalence:
%%$$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} u^+(X_{[i]}) (w^+(\frac{n-i}{n}) - w^+(\frac{n-i-1}{n})) =  \int_0^M w^+(1-\widehat{F^+_n}(x)) dx, $$
%%and also,
%%$$\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} u^-(X_{[i]}) (w^-(\frac{n-i}{n}) - w^-(\frac{n-i-1}{n})) =  \int_0^M w^-(1-\widehat{F^-_n}(x)) dx, $$
%%
%%where $\widehat{F^+_n}(x)$ and $\widehat{F^-_n}(x)$ are the empirical distribution functions (EDFs) of $u^+(X)$
%%and $u^-(X)$, defined as follows:
%%\begin{align}
%%{\widehat F_n}^+(x)=&\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{(u^+(X_i) \leq x)}, 
%%{\widehat F_n}^-(x)=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n 1_{(u^-(X_i) \leq x)}.
%%\label{eq:edf}
%%\end{align}
%%The main claim follows from the equivalence mentioned above together with the well-known Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality (cf. Chapter 2 of \cite{wasserman2006}).
%
See Section \ref{sec:holder-proofs}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Results for Lipschitz continuous weights}
% In the previous section, it was shown that \holder continuous weights result in an asymptotically consisent CPT-value predictor $\overline \C_n$ under a restrictive Lipschitz assumption on the distribution functions of $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$. 
In this section, we establish that the CPT-value estimator $\overline \C_n$ is asymptotically consistent when the weights are Lipschitz continuous,  i.e., the following assumption in place of (A1):

\noindent\textbf{Assumption (A1').}  The weight functions $w^+, w^-$ are Lipschitz with common constant $L$, and 
$u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ both have bounded first moments.

Setting $\alpha=1$, one can obtain the asymptotic consistency claim in Proposition \ref{prop:holder-asymptotic} for Lipschitz weight functions. However, this result is under  a restrictive Lipschitz assumption on the distribution functions of $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$. Using a different proof technique and (A1') in place of (A1), we can obtain a result similar to Proposition \ref{prop:holder-asymptotic} without a Lipschitz assumption on the distribution functions. The following claim makes this precise.

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:lipschitz}
Assume (A1'). Then, we have that 
$$\overline \C_n
\rightarrow
\C(X)
 \text{   a.s. as } n\rightarrow \infty.
$$
% In addition, if we assume that the utilities $u^+(X)$ and $u^-(X)$ are bounded above by $M<\infty$ w.p. 1, then we have $\forall \epsilon >0, \delta >0$, 
% $$
% \Prob{\left |\overline \C_n- \C(X) \right| \leq  \epsilon } > 1-\delta\text{     ,} \forall n \geq \ln\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\cdot 
% \frac{4L^2 M^2}{\epsilon^{2}}.
% $$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
See Section \ref{sec:lipschitz-proofs}.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
 For \holder continuous weights, we incur a sample complexity of order $O\left(\frac1{\epsilon^{2/\alpha}}\right)$ for accuracy $\epsilon>0$ and this is higher than the canonical Monte Carlo rate of $O\left(\frac1{\epsilon^2}\right)$. On the other hand, setting $\alpha=1$ in Proposition \ref{prop:holder-dkw}, we observe that one can achieve the canonical Monte Carlo rate for Lipschitz continuous weights. Choosing the weights to be the identity function, we observe that the sample complexity cannot be improved.
\end{remark}
