We consider a traffic signal control application where the aim is to improve the road user experience by an adaptive traffic light control (TLC) algorithm.
We apply the CPT-functional to the delay experienced by road users, since CPT realistically captures the attitude of the road users towards delays. We then optimize the CPT-value of the delay and contrast this approach with traditional expected delay optimizing algorithms. It is assumed that the CPT functional's parameters $(u,w)$ are given (usually, these are obtained by observing human behavior). The experiments are performed using the GLD traffic simulator \cite{GLDSim} and the implementation is available at \url{https://bitbucket.org/prashla/rl-gld}.

%\paragraph{Simulation Setup:}  
We consider a road network with $\N$ signalled lanes that are spread across junctions and $\M$ paths, where each path connects (uniquely) two edge nodes, from which the traffic is generated -- cf. \cref{fig:2x2grid}. 
%\todoc{Can we have a higher quality figure?}
At any instant $n$, let $q_n^i$ and $t_n^i$ denote the queue length and elapsed time since the lane turned red, for any lane $i = 1,\ldots, \N$. Let $d_n^{i,j}$ denote the delay experienced by $j$th road user on $i$th path, for any $i=1,\ldots,\M$ and $j=1,\ldots,n_i$, where $n_i$ denotes the number of road users on path $i$.
We specify the various components of the traffic control MDP below.
The state $s_n=(q_n^1,\ldots,q_n^{\N},t_n^1,\ldots,t_n^{\N},d_n^{1,1},\ldots,d_n^{\M,n_{\M}})\tr$ is a vector of lane-wise queue lengths, elapsed times and path-wise delays.
The actions are the feasible traffic signal configurations. 

We consider three different notions of return as follows:
%
\textbf{CPT:} Let $\mu^i$ be the proportion of road users along path $i$, for $i=1,\ldots,\M$. Any road user along path $i$, will evaluate the delay he experiences in a manner that is captured well by CPT. Let $X_i$ be the delay r.v. for path $i$ and let the corresponding CPT-value be $\C(X_i)$. With the objective of maximizing the experience of road users across paths, the overall return to be optimized is given by
\begin{align}
\text{CPT}(X_1,\ldots,X_{\M}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu^i \C(X_i).\label{eq:cpt-traffic}
\end{align}
\textbf{EUT:} Here we only use the utility functions $u^+$ and $u^-$ to handle gains and losses, but do not distort probabilities. 
Thus, the EUT objective is defined as
\begin{align*}
\text{EUT}(X_1,\ldots,X_{\M}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu^i \left(\E(u^+(X_i) - \E(u^-(X_i)\right),
\end{align*}
where $\E(u^+(X_i)) = \intinfinity \Prob{u^+(X_i)>z} dz$ and $\E(u^-(X_i)) - \intinfinity \Prob{u^-(X_i)>z} dz$, for $i=1,\ldots,\M$.

\textbf{AVG:} This is EUT without the distinction between gains and losses via utility functions, i.e.,\\[1ex] 
\centerline{$\text{AVG}(X_1,\ldots,X_{\M}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu^i \E(X_i).$} 
%Thus, the AVG objective is defined as
%\begin{align}
%\text{AVG}(X_1,\ldots,X_{\M}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu^i \E(X_i).
%\end{align}   
%where $\E(X_i) = \intinfinity P(u^+(X_i)>z) dz - \intinfinity P(u^-(X_i)>z) dz$.

An important component of CPT is to employ a reference point to calculate gains and losses. 
%Choosing a suitable reference point is challenging, but \cite{tversky1992advances} advocate using status-quo as the reference point. 
In our setting, we use path-wise delays obtained from a pre-timed TLC (cf. the Fixed TLCs in \cite{prashanth2011reinforcement}) as the reference point. If the delay of any algorithm (say CPT-SPSA) is less than that of pre-timed TLC, then the (positive) difference in delays is perceived as a gain and in the complementary case, the delay difference is perceived as a loss. Thus, the CPT-value $\C(X_i)$ for any path $i$ in \eqref{eq:cpt-traffic} is to be understood as a \textit{differential delay}.  

%, as the road network considered is high-dimensional (state space cardinality $> 10^{60}$). 

Using a Boltzmann policy that has the form
$$
\pi_{\theta}(s,a) = \frac{e^{\theta^{\top} \phi_{s,a}}}{\sum_{a' \in {\A(s)}} e^{\theta^{\top} \phi_{s,a'}}},
\hspace{6pt} \forall s \in \S,\;\forall a \in \A(s),
$$
with features $\phi_{s,a}$ as described in Section V-B of \cite{prashanth2012threshold},
we implement the following TLC algorithms:

{\bf\em CPT-SPSA}: This is the first-order algorithm with SPSA-based gradient estimates, as described in Algorithm \ref{alg:1spsa}. In particular, the estimation scheme in Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est} is invoked to estimate $\C(X_i)$ for each path $i=1,\ldots,\M$, with $d_n^{i,j}, j=1,\ldots,n_i$ as the samples.

{\bf\em EUT-SPSA}: This is similar to CPT-SPSA, except that weight functions $w^+(p)=w^-(p)=p,$ for $p\in [0,1]$. 

{\bf\em AVG-SPSA}: This is similar to CPT-SPSA, except that weight functions $w^+(p)=w^-(p)=p,$ for $p\in [0,1]$. 

For both CPT-SPSA and EUT-SPSA, we set the utility functions (see \eqref{eq:cpt-general}) as follows:
$$u^+(x) =  |x|^{\sigma}, \text{ and  }u^-(x) = \lambda |x|^{\sigma},$$ 
where $\lambda = 2.25$ and $\sigma = 0.88$.
For CPT-SPSA, we set the weights as follows:
\begin{align*}
w^+(p) &= \frac{p^{\eta_1}}{{(p^{\eta_1}+ (1-p)^{\eta_1})}^{\frac{1}{\eta_1}}}, \text{ and }\\  
w^-(p) &= \frac{p^{\eta_2}}{{(p^{\eta_2}+ (1-p)^{\eta_2})}^{\frac{1}{\eta_2}}},
\end{align*} 
where $\eta_1 = 0.61$ and $\eta_2 = 0.69$. The choices for $\lambda$, $\sigma$, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are based on median estimates given by \cite{tversky1992advances} and have been used earlier in a traffic application (see \cite{gao2010adaptive}).
For all the algorithms,
 motivated by standard guidelines (see \cite{spall2005introduction}),
 we set $\delta_n = 1.9/n^{0.101}$ and $a_n = 1/(n+50)$. The initial point $\theta_0$ is the $d$-dimensional vector of ones and $\forall i$, the operator $\Gamma_i$ projects $\theta_i$ onto the set $[0.1, 10.0]$.
    
The experiments involve two phases:
first, a training phase where we run each algorithm for $200$ iterations, with each iteration involving two perturbed simulations, each of trajectory length $500$. This is followed by a test phase where we fix the policy for each algorithm and $100$ independent simulations of the MDP (each with a trajectory length of $1000$) are performed. After each run in the test phase, the overall CPT-value \eqref{eq:cpt-traffic} is estimated. 
%\paragraph{Results:} 

Figures \ref{fig:avg}--\ref{fig:cpt} present the histogram of the CPT-values from the test phase for AVG-SPSA, EUT-SPSA and CPT-SPSA, respectively.  A similar exercise for pre-timed TLC resulted in a CPT-value of $-46.14$. It is evident that each algorithm converges to a different policy. However, the CPT-value of the resulting policies is highest in the case of CPT-SPSA, followed by EUT-SPSA and AVG-SPSA in that order. Intuitively, this is expected because AVG-SPSA uses neither utilities nor probability distortions, while EUT-SPSA distinguishes between gains and losses using utilities while not using weights to distort probabilities.
The results in Figure \ref{fig:histogram-perf} argue for specialized algorithms that incorporate CPT-based criteria, esp. in the light of previous findings which show CPT matches human evaluation well and there is a need for algorithms that serve human needs well.
%\todoc{It would be nice to point out how the CPT policy is different than the others.}
