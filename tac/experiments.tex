We consider a traffic signal control application where the aim is to improve the road user experience by an adaptive traffic light control (TLC) algorithm.
We apply the CPT-functional to the delay experienced by road users, since CPT realistically captures the attitude of the road users towards delays. We then optimize the CPT-value of the delay and contrast this approach with traditional expected delay minimizing algorithms. It is assumed that the CPT functional's parameters $(u,w)$ are given (usually, these are obtained by observing human behavior). The experiments are performed using the GLD traffic simulator \cite{GLDSim}, and the implementation is available at \url{https://bitbucket.org/prashla/rl-gld}.

% \subsection{Simulation Setup}  
We consider a road network with $\N$ signalled lanes that are spread across junctions and $\M$ paths, where each path connects (uniquely) two edge nodes, from which the traffic is generated -- See \cref{fig:road-net}. 
%\todoc{Can we have a higher quality figure?}
At any instant $n$, let $q_n^i$ and $t_n^i$ denote the queue length and elapsed time since the lane turned red, for any lane $i = 1,\ldots, \N$. Let $d_n^{i,j}$ denote the delay experienced by $j$th road user on $i$th path, for any $i=1,\ldots,\M$ and $j=1,\ldots,n_i$, where $n_i$ denotes the number of road users on path $i$.
We specify the various components of the traffic control MDP below.
The state $s_n=(q_n^1,\ldots,q_n^{\N},t_n^1,\ldots,t_n^{\N},d_n^{1,1},\ldots,d_n^{\M,n_{\M}})\tr$ is a vector of lane-wise queue lengths, elapsed times and pathwise delays. Any combination of traffic lights that can simultaneously be switched to green constitutes an action in the MDP.
% The actions are the feasible traffic signal configurations.

We consider Boltzmann policies that have the form
$$
\pi_{\theta}(s,a) = \frac{e^{\theta^{\top} \phi_{s,a}}}{\sum_{a' \in {\A(s)}} e^{\theta^{\top} \phi_{s,a'}}},
\hspace{6pt} \forall s \in \S,\;\forall a \in \A(s),
$$
with features $\phi_{s,a}$ as described in Section V-B of \cite{prashanth2012threshold}.
% We consider two different notions of return as follows:
% %
% \textbf{CPT:} 
For any policy $\theta$, let $X_i^\theta$ be the delay r.v. and $\mu_i^\theta$ the proportion of road users along path $i$, for $i=1,\ldots,\M$. 
Any road user along path $i$ will evaluate the delay (s)he experiences in a manner that is captured well by CPT. 
An important component of CPT is to employ a reference point to calculate gains and losses. 
%Choosing a suitable reference point is challenging, but \cite{tversky1992advances} advocate using status-quo as the reference point. 
In our setting, we use pathwise delays, say $B_i$ for path $i$, obtained from a pre-timed TLC (cf. the Fixed TLCs in \cite{prashanth2011reinforcement}) as the reference point.
If the delay of any TLC algorithm is less than that of pre-timed TLC, then the (positive) difference in delays is perceived as a gain and in the complementary case, the delay difference is perceived as a loss. Thus, the CPT-value $\C(B_i-X_i)$ for any path $i$ in \eqref{eq:cpt-traffic} is to be understood as a \textit{differential delay} w.r.t. $B_i$.  
Now, the objective is to maximize the weighted sum of CPT-values across paths, i.e., 
% With the objective of maximizing the experience of road users across paths, the overall return to be optimized is given by
\begin{align}
\max_{\theta \in \Theta} \text{CPT}(X_1^\theta,\ldots,X_{\M}^\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu_i^\theta \C(B_i - X_i^\theta),\label{eq:cpt-traffic}
\end{align}
where $\Theta$ is the $d$-dimensional hypercube formed by intervals $[0.1,1.0]$ in each dimension. The rationale behind the objective above is that CPT-value $\C(B_i - X_i^\theta)$ would capture the road user experience/satisfaction for each path $i$ and the goal is to maximize the \textit{average satisfaction} over all paths.  
% where  $\C(B_i-X_i)$ is the CPT-value along path $i$ for differential delay r.v. $B_i-X_i$. 
% \textbf{EUT:} Here we only use the utility functions $u^+$ and $u^-$ to handle gains and losses, but do not distort probabilities. 
% Thus, the EUT objective is defined as
% \begin{align*}
% \text{EUT}(X_1,\ldots,X_{\M}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu^i \left(\E(u^+(X_i) - \E(u^-(X_i)\right),
% \end{align*}
% where $\E(u^+(X_i)) = \intinfinity \Prob{u^+(X_i)>z} dz$ and $\E(u^-(X_i)) - \intinfinity \Prob{u^-(X_i)>z} dz$, for $i=1,\ldots,\M$.

For the sake of comparison, we consider the traditional objective of minimizing the overall average delay, i.e.,
\begin{align}
\min_{\theta\in \Theta}\text{AVG}(X_1^\theta,\ldots,X_{\M}^\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu_i^\theta \E(X_i^\theta). \label{eq:avg-traffic} 
\end{align}
In comparison to CPT objective, the above does not incorporate baseline delays, makes no distinction between gains and losses via utility functions and does not distort probabilities. 
%Thus, the AVG objective is defined as
%\begin{align}
%\text{AVG}(X_1,\ldots,X_{\M}) = \sum_{i=1}^{\M} \mu^i \E(X_i).
%\end{align}   
%where $\E(X_i) = \intinfinity P(u^+(X_i)>z) dz - \intinfinity P(u^-(X_i)>z) dz$.
% An important component of CPT is to employ a reference point to calculate gains and losses. 
% %Choosing a suitable reference point is challenging, but \cite{tversky1992advances} advocate using status-quo as the reference point. 
% In our setting, we use path-wise delays obtained from a pre-timed TLC (cf. the Fixed TLCs in \cite{prashanth2011reinforcement}) as the reference point.

We implement the following TLC algorithms:

{\bf\em CPT-SPSA}: This is a first-order algorithm (see Algorithm \ref{alg:1spsa}) that solves \eqref{eq:cpt-traffic} using SPSA-based gradient estimates and the scheme from Algorithm \ref{alg:holder-est} for estimating CPT-value \\$\C(B_i-X_i)$ for each path $i=1,\ldots,\M$, with $d_n^{i,j}, j=1,\ldots,n_i$ as the samples.

% {\bf\em EUT-SPSA}: This is similar to CPT-SPSA, except that weight functions $w^+(p)=w^-(p)=p,$ for $p\in [0,1]$. 

{\bf\em AVG-SPSA}: This is SPSA-based first-order algorithm that solves \eqref{eq:avg-traffic}, while using sample averages of the delays to estimate the expected delay $\E(X_i)$ for each path $i=1,\ldots,\M$. 

The underlying CPT-value $\C(X_i), \forall i$ follows the exact form as in section \ref{sec:expts-simple}, except here we set $\lambda = 2.25$.

The choices for $\lambda$, $\sigma$, $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are based on median estimates given by \cite{tversky1992advances} and have been used earlier in a traffic application (see \cite{gao2010adaptive}).
For all the algorithms,
 motivated by standard guidelines (see \cite{spall2005introduction}),
 we set $\delta_n = 1.9/n^{0.101}$ and $a_n = 1/(n+50)$. The initial point $\theta_0$ is the $d$-dimensional vector of ones and $\forall i$, the operator $\Gamma_i$ keeps the iterate $\theta_i$ bounded within $[0.1, 1.0]$.

The experiments involve two phases:
first, a training phase where we run each algorithm for $500$ iterations, with each iteration involving two perturbed simulations. Each simulation involves running the traffic simulator with a fixed policy parameter for $5000$ steps and this corresponds to approximately $4000$ delay samples. The training phase is followed by a test phase where we fix the policy obtained at the end of training and then run the traffic simulator with the aforementioned parameter for $5000$ steps. The results presented are averages over ten independent simulations.

% \subsection{Results} 

Table \ref{tab:cpt-results} presents the overall AVG and CPT-values for AVG-SPSA and CPT-SPSA, and as expected, AVG-SPSA exhibits a better AVG-value, while CPT-SPSA shows a higher CPT value. While the results in Table \ref{tab:cpt-results} are aggregated over all the paths in Figure \ref{fig:road-net}, we also analyze the delays over each path for both algorithms. 
Figures \ref{fig:avg}--\ref{fig:cpt} present the expected delay and CPT of differential delay for each of the $12$ paths in Figure \ref{fig:road-net}, obtained from the test phase for AVG-SPSA and CPT-SPSA, respectively.  
% A similar exercise for pre-timed TLC resulted in a CPT-value of $-46.14$. 
%It is evident that each algorithm converges to a different policy and the difference, in $\ell_1$ norm, between policy parameters obtained at the end of training phase for AVG-SPSA and CPT-SPSA was observed to be $6.51$. 
% As shown in Table \ref{tab:cpt-results},  AVG-SPSA results in a TLC policy with lower expected delay, while CPT-SPSA's policy has higher CPT-value. This is expected because AVG-SPSA uses neither utilities nor probability distortions and minimizes overall delay, while CPT-SPSA uses a pre-timed TLC baseline and treats delay gains and losses differently. 
We observe that on $5$ paths, CPT-SPSA gives significantly better CPT-value, while on the remaining $7$ paths, the CPT-value of CPT-SPSA and AVG-SPSA are comparable. From an expected delay viewpoint, AVG-SPSA exhibits lower expected delay on $4$ paths, while on the remaining paths the expected delay of AVG-SPSA and CPT-SPSA	are comparable. 


% esp. in the light of previous findings which show CPT matches human evaluation well and there is a need for algorithms that serve human needs well.
%\todoc{It would be nice to point out how the CPT policy is different than the others.}
