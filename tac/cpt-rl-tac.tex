\begin{abstract}
In several real-world systems involving humans, traditional expected value cannot explain the observed behavior and incorporating distortions in the underlying probabilities of the system can alleviate this problem. Cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is a very popular approach based on probabilistic distortions.
We employ the notion of a CPT-value in a stochastic optimization framework and propose algorithms for both estimating and maximizing the CPT-value.
CPT-value estimation is challenging as it requires estimation of the {\it entire distribution} of the underlying random variable.
We propose an empirical distribution function based scheme to estimate the CPT-value and then use this scheme in the inner loop of a CPT-value optimization procedure that is based on two well-known simulation optimization ideas of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) and model-based parameter search (MPS).
We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for all the proposed algorithms and also 
illustrate the usefulness of CPT-based criteria in a traffic signal control application.
%empirically demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
CPT has been a very popular paradigm for modeling human decisions among psychologists/economists, but has escaped the radar of the reinforcement learning community. This work is the first step in incorporating CPT-based criteria into an RL framework. However, both estimation and control of CPT-based value is challenging. 
%Using temporal-difference learning type algorithms for estimation was ruled out for CPT-value since the underlying probabilities get (non-linearly) distorted by a weight function. 
For estimation, we proposed a quantile-based estimation scheme. Next, for the problem of control, since CPT-value does not conform to any Bellman equation, we employed SPSA - a popular simulation optimization scheme and designed a first-order algorithm for optimizing the CPT-value. 
We provided theoretical convergence guarantees for all the proposed algorithms and illustrated the usefulness of our algorithms for optimizing CPT-based criteria in a traffic signal control application.
